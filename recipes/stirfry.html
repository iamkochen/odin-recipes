        <h2>Teriyaki Shrimp and Vegetable Stir-Fry</h2>
        <p>Shrimp, bok choy, broccoli, and zucchini are happy together in a stir-fry that makes its own teriyaki sauce.</p>
        <p>Serve over rice or noodles for a tasty meal.</p>
        <h3>List of Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 heads baby bok choy</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Â½ pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the stem ends of the bok choy off to separate the leaves. Wash and drain the leaves; discard the ends. Cut the leafy green part of the leaves from the white part, keeping both parts separated.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat; add oil. Cook and stir ginger in the hot oil for 1 minute. Add shrimp and continue cooking until they are bright pink and opaque, reducing heat as necessary to prevent burning, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir white pieces of bok choy, broccoli, zucchini, soy sauce, vermouth, brown sugar, and rice vinegar into the skillet. Cover and continue cooking until bok choy begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            
        </ol>
